/* Django’s STATICFILES_FINDERS setting contains a list of finders that know how to
discover static files from various sources. One of the defaults is
AppDirectoriesFinder which looks for a “static” subdirectory in each of the
INSTALLED_APPS, like the one in polls we just created. The admin site uses the same
directory structure for its static files. */


/* Just like templates, we might be able to get away with putting our static files
directly in polls/static (rather than creating another polls subdirectory), but it would
actually be a bad idea. Django will choose the first static file it finds whose name matches,
and if you had a static file with the same name in a different application, Django would
be unable to distinguish between them. We need to be able to point Django at the right one,
and the easiest way to ensure this is by namespacing them. That is, by putting those
static files inside another directory named for the application itself. */
